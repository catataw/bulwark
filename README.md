# Bulwark:  Node.js + PKCS#11

Bulwark is a native Node.js addon that utilizes the RSA PKCS#11 API (v2.20) to perform cryptographic operations.  This module, specifically, acts as a common layer upon which various vendor-specific additions can be made. 

Bulwark utilizes tjfontaine's excellent [`node-addon-layer`](https://github.com/tjfontaine/node-addon-layer) which provides a nice Node.js add-on interface for C.  This allows us to avoid writing the add-on in C++.

## Installation

Installation of Bulwark is fairly straightforward.  Just use npm:

    npm install bulwark
    
## Usage

Bulwark requires a working PKCS#11 implementation in order to function properly.  Most distrubutions include binaries for [Mozilla's NSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS).  NSS offers a pretty good implementation of most PKCS#11 functions, and it's the library I use for my own integration testing with Bulwark.

That said, Bulkwark should work without issue on any PKCS#11 API that is compliant with the PKCS#11 standard, version 2.20.  If you notice any strange issues when using a different implementation, please open an issue and I'll try to help.

Assuming you have a PKCS#11 implementation, using Bulwark is fairly straightforward:

```javascript
var Bulkwark = require("bulwark");

// tell Bulwark where your PKCS#11 library is.
Bulwark.setPKCS11Library("/path/to/libnss3.so");

var bulkwark = new Bulwark({
    chunkSize: 4096,  // how many bytes should be processed for each C_*Update call.
    pin: "security-module-pin",
    log: function(level, message) {
        console.log("[%d]: %s", level, message);
    }
});

bulwark.openSession(function(err, session) {
    // You can perform various functions on the `session` object now.
    session.findSecretKey("my-key", function(err, key) {
        // You can call functions on the `key` object, too.
    });
});
```

## Testing

If you wish to execute the tests for Bulwark, you'll need to have a local installation of NSS.  You can use `make install-nss` to install NSS into `/usr/local` on your system.  Assuming you have NSS installed, `make test` should just work.

## Contributing

Contributions to Bulwark are welcome, however there are some fairly interesting conventions when dealing with native add-ons in Node.js (and specifically Bulwark) that you should be aware of.

Bulwark's integration tests are divided between the native add-on, and the JavaScript that wraps it.  If you take time to read through the C code, you'll notice a distinct lack of input validation.  This is quite intentional.  **Input validation should happen at the JavaScript layer -- not in the native layer**.

This means that the integration tests for the native add-on are really only covering the "happy path" where all inputs are valid.  You'll see quite a bit more test coverage over the JavaScript wrapper as a result.  In general, if you wish to contribute to Bulwark, please follow some simple guidelines:

 * Keep the C code very clean and terse.  Validate input data within the JavaScript boundary, and only pass valid data down to the native C level.
 * JavaScript object creation and especially **modification** within the native boundary is very expensive.  Because of this, the only place we do it is when passing an `Error` object back to a callback function.
 * For performance reasons, make sure that you only interact with the native layer using primitive types.  Primitive types are:  `Number`, `Integer`, `String`, `Buffer`, `Function`, and external pointers (think handles).
